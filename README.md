# ClipCount
This command-line tool is designed to be used with a global keyboard shortcut. 
When executing the tool, it shows the characters, words, and lines of the currently-selected text as a popup. 

## Requirements

* `xsel` or `xclip` to get the currently-selected text (both are supported)
* `zenity` or `kdialog` to display the popup. One of them should be installed by default on every system with GNOME or KDE.
